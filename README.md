# Guess_the_Phrase
 Dare to guess the random phrase. 
 
 This is a small phrase guessing game that was developed using JavaScript
and OOP(Object Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to 
guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

## Game Rules:
* The playerâ€™s goal is to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. At the beginning, the player only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by blank boxes on the screen.
* The player clicks an onscreen keyboard to guess letters in the phrase.
* The letter is disabled on the onscreen keyboard and a player can't select that letter again.
* If the selected letter is not in the phrase, one of the player's hearts in the scoreboard is changed from a "live" heart to a "lost" heart.
* The player keeps choosing letters until they reveal all the letters in the phrase, or they make five incorrect guesses.
## How to Use:
* Clone or download the repository to your computer
* Open the project root folder and double click on index.html
* Then the Guess_the_Phrase javascript game will appear on the default browser tab
